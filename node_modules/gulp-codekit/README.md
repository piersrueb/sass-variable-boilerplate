#gulp-codekit [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![Travis build][travis-image]
>Makes inclusion of files a breeze.  
Supports CodeKit and Prepros include directives.
Heavily based on [gulp-include](http://github.com/wiledal/gulp-include) by [Hugo Wiledal](http://github.com/wiledal)

## Features
* Concatenate files with full control
* Respects indentation whitespace
* Uses [globs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) for simple path control
* Works recursively (files can include files that can include files, and so on)

## Installation
```shell
npm install gulp-codekit
```
## Usage
Example `gulpfile.js`:
```javascript
var gulp          = require("gulp"),
    include       = require("gulp-codekit");

gulp.task("scripts", function() {
  console.log("-- gulp is running task 'scripts'");

  gulp.src("src/js/main.js")
    .pipe(include())
      .on('error', console.log)
    .pipe(gulp.dest("dist/js"));
});

gulp.task("default", ["scripts"]);

```

## Options
* `extensions` (optional)
	* Takes a `String` or an `Array` of extensions, eg: `"js"` or `["js", "coffee"]`
	* If set, all directives that does not match the extension(s) will be ignored

## Include directives
`gulp-codekit` uses directives similar to `sprockets` or `snockets`. A _directive_ is a comment in your files that `gulp-codekit` recognizes as a command.
  
Example directives:
```javascript
//=require vendor/jquery.js
//=require vendor/**/*.js
//=include relative/path/to/file.js
// @codekit-append relative/path/to/file.js
// @codekit-prepend relative/path/to/file.js

> **Note:** Currently codekit-prepend does the same as codekit-append, and works like an include

```
```css
/*=include relative/path/to/file.css */
```
```coffee
#=include relative/path/to/file.coffee
```
```html
<!--=include relative/path/to/file.html -->
```

The contents of the referenced file will replace the file.
  
### `require` vs. `include`
A file that is included with `require` will only be included if it has not been included  before. Files included with `include` will _always_ be included.  
For instance, let's say you want to include `jquery.js` only once, and before any of your other scripts in the same folder.
```javascript
//=require vendor/jquery.js
//=require vendor/*.js
```
Note: This also works recursively. If for instance, for the example above, if another file in the folder `vendor` is also including `jquery.js` with the `require`-directive it will be ignored.
